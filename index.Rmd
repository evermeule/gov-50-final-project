## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to... demographic decline (marriage and fertility rates), perhaps in a specific country, in conjunction with specific economic pressures. I'd specifically like to figure out how to quantify certain ideological metrics, like perspective on marriage, and compare whether ideology or economics are more influential on fertility demographics.
